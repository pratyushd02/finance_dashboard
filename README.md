# Finance Dashboard

A comprehensive financial analytics dashboard designed to process, analyze, and visualize financial datasets. This project leverages data preprocessing techniques, machine learning models, and interactive visualizations to provide insights into financial data.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Automated scripts to download and organize financial datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Jupyter notebooks for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of machine learning models to predict financial trends.
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboard created using Power BI for data visualization.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to track the data processing and modeling pipeline.

   git clone https://github.com/pratyushd02/finance_dashboard.git
   cd finance_dashboard
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt is not present, install the libraries listed in the prerequisites individually.

Run Jupyter Notebooks:

Open and execute the notebooks in the following order:

download_data.ipynb

preprocessing.ipynb

model.ipynb

View the Dashboard:

Open dashboard.pbix using Power BI Desktop to interact with the financial dashboard.
